# Will a customer accept the coupon?
> 
The objective of this project is to leverage knowledge in visualizations and probability distributions to differentiate between customers who accepted a driving coupon and those who did not.  I will be using data analysis and visualizations using Python. 

####

## Usage
- Open the Jupyter Notebook (prompt_JC.ipynb) using Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.
- Execute the code cells to perform the analysis.
- View the generated bar charts to visualize acceptance rates under different conditions.

## Technologies and methods
- Python 
- Python libraries: 
- matplotlib
- seaborn
pandas
numpy

## Data
- The analysis is based on a dataset containing information about drivers, their passengers, and their visits to bars. Ensure that your dataset follows a similar structure for the code to work correctly.

Important Note
Make sure to modify the filtering conditions and column names in the code according to your dataset's actual structure.
