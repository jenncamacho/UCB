# Will a customer accept the coupon?
> 
The objective of this project is to leverage knowledge in visualizations and probability distributions to differentiate between customers who accepted a driving coupon and those who did not.  I will be using data analysis and visualizations using Python. 

####

Usage
Open the Jupyter Notebook (prompt_JC.ipynb) using Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.
Execute the code cells to perform the analysis.
View the generated bar charts to visualize acceptance rates under different conditions.

Technologies and methods
Python 
Python libraries: 
matplotlib
seaborn
pandas
numpy

Data
The analysis is based on a dataset containing information about drivers, their passengers, and their visits to bars. Ensure that your dataset follows a similar structure for the code to work correctly.

Important Note
Make sure to modify the filtering conditions and column names in the code according to your dataset's actual structure.
License

1. Project's Title
This is the name of the project. It describes the whole project in one sentence, and helps people understand what the main goal and aim of the project is.

2. Project Description
This is an important component of your project that many new developers often overlook.

Your description is an extremely important aspect of your project. A well-crafted description allows you to show off your work to other developers as well as potential employers.

The quality of a README description often differentiates a good project from a bad project. A good one takes advantage of the opportunity to explain and showcase:

What your application does,
Why you used the technologies you used,
Some of the challenges you faced and features you hope to implement in the future.
3. Table of Contents (Optional)
If your README is very long, you might want to add a table of contents to make it easy for users to navigate to different sections easily. It will make it easier for readers to move around the project with ease.

4. How to Install and Run the Project
If you are working on a project that a user needs to install or run locally in a machine like a "POS", you should include the steps required to install your project and also the required dependencies if any.

Provide a step-by-step description of how to get the development environment set and running.

5. How to Use the Project
Provide instructions and examples so users/contributors can use the project. This will make it easy for them in case they encounter a problem â€“ they will always have a place to reference what is expected.

You can also make use of visual aids by including materials like screenshots to show examples of the running project and also the structure and design principles used in your project.

Also if your project will require authentication like passwords or usernames, this is a good section to include the credentials.

6. Include Credits
If you worked on the project as a team or an organization, list your collaborators/team members. You should also include links to their GitHub profiles and social media too.
